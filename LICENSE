The Rose-Hulman logo used in the SVG file is used with fair use as we are a club affiliated with Rose-Hulman. The "R" shape was the only copyrighted thing used, but other parts of this shape were created from scratch. So, for now, img/rhlug-logo-scale.svg is copyrighted to prevent potential conflicts.

Currently, we are still deciding on a license for the rest of the project.
For now, it's copyright until then just so we have an agreement. If you have suggestions for what license we should use, please join https://t.me/rhlug.
